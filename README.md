# Chomp
Copyright Â© 2013 Bart Massey

This is a simple computer player for the game
[Chomp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomp) written in
Java. It is intended as a pedagogical exercise: it currently
plays 3x4 Chomp, which is a pretty simple game, and the
computer always plays second. Nonetheless, forcing a win is
surprisingly tricky for a human.

To compile, just say "javac Chomp.java". To run, "java
Chomp".  Moves are input as a two-digit number, with the
first digit the row number and the second digit the column
number. The program is not forgiving of input mistakes:
caveat emptor.
